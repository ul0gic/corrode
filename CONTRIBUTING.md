# Contributing to Corrode

Thank you for wanting to improve Corrode! To keep the project aligned with Corelift LLC's goals, please follow these guidelines:

1. **License Alignment**
   - All contributions are accepted under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.
   - By opening a pull request, you agree that your work can be used in both the open-source AGPL build and any future dual-licensed releases managed by Corelift LLC (ul0gic).

2. **Attribution**
   - Public shoutouts, blog posts, talks, or demos built on Corrode must credit **Corelift LLC** and **ul0gic**.
   - If you showcase Corrode in your own tooling, include "Powered by Corrode (Corelift LLC / ul0gic)" in your documentation or UI.

3. **No Closed-Source Resale**
   - You cannot take Corrode, repackage it, and sell it as a closed-source product or service. Commercial offerings must either remain AGPL compliant or obtain a commercial license from Corelift LLC.
   - Hosting "Corrode-as-a-Service" requires releasing your modified source to users under the AGPL.

4. **Pull Request Expectations**
   - Keep PRs scoped and well-tested; include sample targets or fixtures if you’re touching the scanner pipeline.
   - Describe any new detections, dependencies, or permissions.
   - Note whether your change impacts PenPal integrations or dual-license plans.

5. **Code of Conduct**
   - Be respectful, assume best intent, and focus on constructive feedback. Harassment or discriminatory language won’t be tolerated.
